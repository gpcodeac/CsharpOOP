var vs T in FoodRepository/DrinkRepository Update method?

Update methos in repos - replace object with new one, or update properties of existing one?

Remove all objects from repo list, or only first? Where is the uniqueness being handled in code or db?

UI layer should not have any interfaces, is that correct?

Still, regarding combining foods and drinks. I cannot do them in the ViewModel, because I would like them to manage as part of the order and then save them to DB? But not as itself, but as a link from an order.
